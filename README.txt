This package contains codes for sonority-based syllabification of speech signals. 

Version 0.21 (5.10.2017)

------------
Basic pipeline:
    1) compute gammatone-envelopes for speech signals with 1000 Hz sampling rate
    2) call thetaOscillator.m with the Gammatone envelopes as input 
    3) Syllable boundaries are in the "bounds" and "bounds_t" output variables 
	(in 1000 Hz frames and seconds, respectively).

Adjust threshold parameter of thetaOscillator for sensitivity adjustments.
    
See SylSegDemo.m for an example.

Note that the package uses Gammatone-filterbank front-end by Ning Ma 
(http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/N.Ma/resources/gammatone/). 
If you are not using 64-bit OS X environment, compile the function first with
"mex gammatone_c.c". Also, re-compiling might be required for newer versions of 64-bit OS X
is the computation freezes without an apparent reason.

Also uses peakdet.m from Eli Billauer (see the file for license).
